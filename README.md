# Networking
This is my networking repository
All content posted in here is posted to be a tool and a reference to important aspects of networking.
I am working to gain knowlege in differetn aspects of Networking. As I learn I will add to this folder
with more dedails. You can follow along with me and learn what I have learned and hopefully it does one 
of two things; you can learn something new and grow your carrer as I strve to do the same, or you see
what I have appomplished and learned and want to have be a part of your team. I am working for my CCNA,
and there will be a sub-repositiory for that in here along with a folder of thins that I am working on
in the feild.
